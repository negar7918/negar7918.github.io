Hello, my name is Negar. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from KTH and at the moment I am a postdoctoral researcher at RIKEN working on approximate Bayesian inference.

## Research Interest

I am interested in probabilistic machine learning and its application to biology and deep learning theory. 

One example of research questions that interests me: How can we build tools to extract biologically meaningful embeddings? For a cell image, is it enough to, for example, aim for geometrically-transform-invariant features in a deep learning framework or can we do more?
