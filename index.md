Hello, my name is Negar. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from KTH and at the moment I am a postdoctoral researcher at RIKEN working on approximate Bayesian inference.

## Research Interest

I am interested in probabilistic machine learning and its application to biology and deep learning theory. 

One example of research questions that interests me: How can we build tools to extract biologically meaningful embeddings? For a cell image, is it enough to, for example, aim for geometrically-transform-invariant features in a deep learning framework or can we do more?



## Publications

The latest article, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01121">VaiPhy</a> presented at NeurIPS 2022, is the first method applying traditional variational inference (VI) on phylogeny (task of tree reconstruction of the historical biological events); VI is very fast compared to MCMC methods which are common in phylogenetic inference. The advantage of run-time makes VI very attractive for any high dimensional data.
