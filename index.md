## About me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpeg" width="150" height="200"  style="float: left">

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, my name is Negar. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from KTH &nbsp;&nbsp;and at the moment I am a postdoctoral researcher at RIKEN approximate &nbsp;&nbsp;Bayesian inference team.

## Research Interests

I am interested in probabilistic machine learning and its application to biology and deep learning theory. 

Some examples of research questions that interests me:
1. How can we build tools to <b>extract biologically meaningful embeddings</b>?
2. How can we <b>augment biologically relevant signals</b> when performing approximate Bayesian inference?
3. What happens theoretically in the inference framework when <b>posterior collapse</b> occurs and how can we push away this event?    



## Publications

The latest article, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01121">VaiPhy</a> presented at NeurIPS 2022, is the first method applying traditional variational inference (VI) on phylogeny (task of tree reconstruction of the historical biological events); VI is very fast compared to Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Variational deep learning methods which are common in phylogenetic inference. The advantage of run-time makes VI very attractive for any high dimensional data.
